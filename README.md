KP's testing ground

KP is a designer at Chargeback in South Jordan, UT. He does his best to work on UX, product, and design testing and implementation for the team, and enjoys cycling to work most days. He's also sort of a health-nut.

Kevin is looking to branch more into coding/markup and merge the skills into his master skill-set.
